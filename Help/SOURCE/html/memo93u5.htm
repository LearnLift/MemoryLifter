<h2 class=Topic><a NAME=flashcards_and_the_box_system></a>Flashcards and 
 t<b>he box system </b></h2>

<p>The LearnLift MemoryLifter program uses the concept of flashcards with 
 the box system to support your vocabulary learning needs. Below is a quick 
 overview of the concepts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=SubTopic1><b style="font-weight: bold;">Flashcards</b></p>

<p>'Traditional' educational flashcards are made of cardboard and are used 
 for verbatim memorization/learning of vocabularies. The flashcard tyically 
 contains a short, concrete question with a short, definite answer. The 
 question is displayed on the front of the card, and the answer on the 
 back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cards in MemoryLifter is fashioned after the concept of the learning 
 flashcard where the question and answer is stored on the front and back 
 of the card respectively. However, MemoryLifter allows additional data 
 which can be example sentences, sounds, video and/or an image to enhance 
 the learning experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=SubTopic1><b style="font-weight: bold;">The box system</b></p>

<p>The box system (also called &quot;Leitner system&quot;) was originally 
 conceived by German psychologist Sebastian Leitner in the 1960s. Its purpose 
 is to provide a structure for people to learn and retain vocabularies 
 in short-term and long-term memory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box system is comprised of a set of <i>x</i> boxes (10 in the case 
 of MemoryLifter), each containing a certain number of flashcards. This 
 amount rises proportionally with the box's number. Also, the higher the 
 box number, the nearer are the respective cards in the long-term memory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, at any time the quantity of flashcards inside each box level provides 
 a quick feedback of the current state of the user's knowledge, and the 
 memory retention (short-tern and/or long-term).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=SubTopic1><b style="font-weight: bold;">MemoryLifter's box system 
 algorithm</b></p>

<p>MemoryLifter uses a slightly modified version of the original box system 
 algorithm to present and track the vocabularies for learning.</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;"

	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"
		class=kadov-p><p>Initially, all cards are derived from the pool, 
 which contains all cards available.</p></li>
	
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"
		class=kadov-p><p>Check whether any of the boxes are full. If so, 
 ask a card from that box. If none of the boxes are full, place a new card 
 from the pool in the first box and ask it.</p></li>
	
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"
		class=kadov-p><p>If the card is answered correctly, promote it 
 to the next box; otherwise, demote it to box 1.</p></li>
	
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"
		class=kadov-p><p>When placing a card in a box, put it at the end. 
 When asking a card from the box, ask in the order it was placed in the 
 box (first in - first out principle).</p></li>
	
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"
		class=kadov-p><p>Continue with step 2 - 4 until the pool is empty.</p></li>
	
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"
		class=kadov-p><p>If the pool is empty, then the oldest card from 
 the dictionary will be asked. A message box will be opened to inform you 
 about this.</p></li>
