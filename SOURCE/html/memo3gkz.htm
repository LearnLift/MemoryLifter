<h2 class=Topic><a NAME=features></a><b>Features </b></h2>

<p>MemoryLifter offers many advanced, easy-to-use features, that can improve 
 your learning experience, or just make it more fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><a HREF="memo93u5.htm"><b>Box system</b></a><b>.</b> 
 This learning method helps you to focus on more difficult words, while 
 still retaining words you knew and ask them from time to time. Plus, the 
 distribution of the flashcards inside the boxes give you an idea of your 
 progress at first sight.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><a HREF="memo8y43.htm"><b>Synonyms</b></a><b>.</b> 
 MemoryLifter offers various options to treat synonyms of a word in an 
 easy, intuitive way.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Sentences.</b> A sample 
 sentence can be provided for each word, showing you a possible use of 
 the word in real life. By default, this sentence just has demonstratory 
 purpose, and doesn't need to be answered.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Audio and Video.</b> 
 Both audio and video can be associated for each word, giving you a better 
 idea how to pronounce words. You can even add audio yourself using the 
 built-in, easy-to-use recording tools.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Images.</b> Connect 
 an image to a card for a more visual learning experience. Most common 
 image formats are supported, even animations (using the .GIF format) are 
 possible!</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Learning modes.</b> 
 There's quite a few learning modes to choose from, including standard 
 text input, multiple choice, listening comprehension and self assessment. 
 If desired, these can be randomized.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><a HREF="memo2koj.htm"><b>Statistics</b></a> present 
 useful feedback on your learning progress over time.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><a HREF="memo9otv.htm"><b>Chapters</b></a> help you 
 to logically order to your cards in the dictionary, so you can in turn 
 focus on learning just a necessary part of the whole dictionary.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Adding cards</b> has 
 never been as easy as with MemoryLifter. Either enter them by <a HREF="memo8nl0.htm">hand</a>, 
 or use the Collect feature to collect words while you are reading an electronic 
 document, such as a webpage.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Powerful <a HREF="memo6dis.htm">import</a> 
 and <a HREF="memo5ur8.htm">export</a> feature.</b> Both import and export 
 functions support common, text-based formats (csv delimited, tab delimited, 
 etc.). They can be customized to suit your needs.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p><a HREF="memo4f78.htm"><b>Printing</b></a><b>.</b> 
 If you need to print a list of vocabulary, just specify the chapters you 
 want to print, the number of columns and the font size, as well as some 
 other options, and it's done. Optionally, you can export words and print 
 them using a word processor.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>The <b>learning planner</b> can tell you when to 
 stop learning, putting the program in the task tray, where it sleeps for 
 a random amount of time before asking you a few questions.</li>
</ul>
