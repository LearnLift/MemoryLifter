<h2>
    PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>
    Your privacy is important to us and our privacy policy is succinctly explained below.
</p>
<h2>
    Collection And Disclosure Of Information</h2>
<p>
    LEARNLIFT collects and stores information about registered users of its software
    and website so that we can efficiently provide services to our customers. We use
    information about our customers to provide or enhance the services we make available,
    to enhance our ability to communicate with our customers about additional services
    they may find of value, to satisfy our legitimate business interests (including
    performing trend analysis and market studies), to set prices, establish credit,
    fulfill contracts, accomplish billing functions, and to comply with government regulations.
    LEARNLIFT is the sole owner of information we collect. As LEARNLIFT collects and
    uses information about our customers, we may contract with vendors, business partners
    and other third-party sources to assist us in processing that information or providing
    customer services. These third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality
    of the information we provide and are restricted from using the information for
    any purpose other than helping to provide our services to our customers. Some of
    the information we collect is personal data or data which relates to an identifiable
    person. Examples of personal data are names, street addresses, e-mail addresses
    and telephone numbers. We do not sell information to third parties that could be
    used to specifically identify an individual customer. We may, however, share personal
    data with certain of our business partners in situations where you are using a LEARNLIFT
    service with or through that partner or vendor. LEARNLIFT also may share aggregated
    demographic data with our strategic partners and advertisers. This type of data
    is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
    Finally, we may provide aggregated or personal data to government agencies as required
    by law. In addition to the uses of the information described in the paragraphs above,
    we collect telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and other contact information in
    the event that we have to contact customers or vendors to resolve a question or
    provide other customer services.
</p>
<h2>
    Security And Integrity Of Information</h2>
<p>
    LEARNLIFT makes every effort to protect collected data against loss and unauthorized
    access. We employ industry accepted information security techniques to appropriately
    protect confidential information from unauthorized access. Access to customer information
    is limited to our employees who have a legitimate business need for that information.
    Our website and its supporting systems employ generally accepted information security
    techniques such as SSL (secure socket layer), and access control procedures to appropriately
    protect confidential information from unauthorized access.
</p>
<h2>
    Retention Of Customer Information</h2>
<p>
    We retain information about customers as necessary for business purposes and as
    required by government regulation. The Federal Government may require us, as well
    as other third parties, to maintain and share with each other, records of certain
    personal information. We carefully dispose of records and delete information when
    our internal retention periods expire.
