<h2 class=Topic><a NAME=ideas_for_usage></a><b>Ideas </b></h2>

<p>MemoryLifter can be used in quite a few more applications than the obvious, 
 regular vocabulary learning. Here's a list of ideas for different &quot;dictionaries&quot;, 
 which is by no means complete:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=SubTopic1><b style="font-weight: bold;">Languages</b> </p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Use sentences to see the word you're learning in 
 context. Thus, when creating your flashcard dictionary, be sure to include 
 an example sentence with the word you are trying to learn.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Sound files give you an idea of pronouncation. If 
 you happen to know a native speaker, request him/her to record the sounds 
 for you. This process will take him only a few minutes, thanks to the 
 built-in <a HREF="memo4dyq.htm">sound recorder</a>, and helps you a lot 
 while learning.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Especially for children, image and video files may 
 help memorizing basic vocabulary.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=SubTopic1><b style="font-weight: bold;">Children</b> </p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Take advantage of sounds and sample sentences to 
 introduce your child to the alphabet.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Memorize multiplication tables easily.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Teach your child the most important traffic signs 
 and rules, utilizing image and sentence features (for rules of behaviour).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=SubTopic1><b style="font-weight: bold;">School</b> </p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Do you instantly recognize a country, its name, capital 
 and native language when just seeing the outline on a world map? Train 
 your geography skills in image recognition mode, and even utilize videos 
 to give you a more vivid background on the country.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Make the memorization of mathematical formulas a 
 problem of the past using MemoryLifter!</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Go a step further in physics by providing explanatory 
 animations for the formulas you want to learn!</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Learning of important historical dates can be vastly 
 improved by giving connections in the sample sentence, or even images. 
 After having learned for some time, try the <a HREF="memo1d9v.htm">multiple-choice</a> 
 learning mode to see how clearly you can differentiate the dates!</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Be it parts of the human body or the evolution, biology 
 comes forward for learning using flashcards.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Have to learn a poem or something similar by heart? 
 Use MemoryLifter for the most difficult stanzas.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=SubTopic1><b style="font-weight: bold;">Everyday life</b> </p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Troubles recognizing the meaning between the multitude 
 of abbreviations that are flooding our everyday life are bound to disappear. 
 Use the standard fields for the word and its abbreviation, and the sample 
 sentence feature to give you more details on the word, its context, etc.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Never forget birthdays, wedding anniversaries and 
 similar dates again. Yet again, use the image feature to give an even 
 better association, or maybe sound for some piece of music you connect 
 with the respective person.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Let MemoryLifter help you remembering names, hobbies, 
 birthdays and other data of persons you rarely see, just learnt to know, 
 etc. This offers itself for usage of images.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Telephone numbers would be another application.</li>
</ul>
