Microsoft® DirectPlay® does not send messages faster than the receiving computer can process them. As a result, if the sending computer is sending faster than the receiver can receive, messages accumulate in the sender's queue. If the application registers that the send queue is growing too large, it should slow the rate that messages are sent. Deprecated.</summary>
